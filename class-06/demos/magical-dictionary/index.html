# The Magic of JavaScript Objects

---

# Introduction

An Object is like a Dictionary
```
var englishToFrenchDictionary = {
  hello: "bonjour",
  goodbye: "au revoir",
  yes: "oui",
  no:"non",
  "good evening":"bonsoir"
}
```
--
the part to left of colon is called the 'key'

--

the part to right of colon is called the 'value'

--

They are often referred to together as 'key value pairs'

--

Notice the key for "good evening" is in quotes because it is multi word

---

we usually access the value in an object with a dot

e.g. `someObject.someKey`

`englishToFrenchDictionary.hello` has the value "bonjour"

--

au revoir

bonsoir

oui

Is it night time? non

oui

---

# An Object is like a Magical Dictionary

So far our magical dictionary has not shown a lot of magical abilities

--

Dictiories are 'alive' - meaning you can add things to them

fruitDictionary.banana : A nutritious yellow fruit. Peel just before eating

--

You can also delete from them

{"banana":"A nutritious yellow fruit. Peel just before eating"}

---

Now we will get to the real MAGIC

The values in an object can by ANYTHING!

--

Well almost anything. They can be any JavaScript expression

--

They can be : 
  - strings
  - booleans
  - numbers
  - arrays
  - even other Objects and more!

{"banana":{"name":"banana","description":"A nutritious yellow fruit. Peel just before eating"}}

--

How do you show the description for banana?

A nutritious yellow fruit. Peel just before eating

--

Can a value be a function?

Yes! Let's create new Object with functions inside

Return value from calling eat function on apple object = Delicious!
